Here, I will try to log as much progress as I can, noting particular highlights in my learning.


***** MY RECENT LIFE STORY *****  
To start, I graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with a degree in Computer Science in the Summer of 2019, but felt that I did not get what I wanted from the program. For one, I chose the "Systems" specialization, which dealt primarily with embedded systems, low-level programming, ARM microprocessors, and sensors. However, I found myself not developing on these as much as I wanted to after graduation. 

For a year after graduation, I decided to continue working part-time in Bloomington, IN--up until I felt I needed a change in my life due to how much the COVID-19 pandemic put it on hold.

Hence, I moved to the Chicago area on 10/1/2020 to pursue a job in the tech industry and put my degree to use. Unfortunately, as of writing this on 8/16/2021, I have had little luck in securing an opportunity, and have chosen to expand my abilities in web development--particularly for the ease-of-access to development resources. As I see little point in going through a bootcamp program for at least three months, I have opted for the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy. Of course, most of the course has been review, since I have worked with HTML/CSS in the past, and JavaScript is certainly a more straightforward language than C! 

As it turns out, I'm highly motivated to learn in this field, and have many application ideas I wish to develop.
