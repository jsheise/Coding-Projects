Q: when set to height 100%, why does the blue bar exceed the page height when active?
A: because the header and paragraph above it are taking up vertical space.

Things to do/optimize/practice:
1. adjust so that active bar takes up entire right side, regardless of above elements
2. currently, box dimensions are percentage of viewport, though need to make opposing dimension of
"active" one the same both ways (i.e. vertical bar has same width as horizontal bar's height).
